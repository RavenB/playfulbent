Hi <%= @invitation.name %>,

A friend of yours has uploaded some risque photos of themselves onto the web at playfulbent.com, and they thought you might like to take a look.

<% if !@invitation.message.blank? -%>
They have added the following personal comments for you:

--------------------
<%= @invitation.message %>
--------------------
<% end -%>

We can't tell you who they are, unless it's clear from the above message, but they knew your email address, so we presume they know you.

You can take a better look at their photos by going to this URL:

<%= strip_photo_url(@invitation.strip_show.first_photo) %>

However, to see the rest of your friend's photos, you will need to show them some of yours. Photo sharing on playful-bent is secure and intimate, and if you're interested you can read more about that on the site.

If you believe that you received this email in error, please let us know at abuse@playfulbent.com and we will give whoever sent this mail a sound spanking.

Kind Regards

Playful-Bent
