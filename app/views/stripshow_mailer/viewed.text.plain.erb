Hi <%= @recipient.name %>,

<%= @viewer.name %> has viewed one of your strip-show photos, and in the process, they have allowed
you to view <%= @photos.length > 1 ? "several" : "one" %> of theirs.

<% if @photos.length == 1 -%>
To view the next available photo in this Strip-Show (login required), use the following URL:

<%= url_for :controller => 'stripshows', :action => 'next_unviewed', :id => @photos[0].strip_show, :only_path => false %>
<% else -%>
To view the next available photo in each of these Strip-Shows (login required),
use one of the URLs below.

<% @photos.each do |photo| -%>
* <%= url_for :controller => 'stripshows', :action => 'next_unviewed', :id => photo.strip_show, :only_path => false %>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>

have fun :)
